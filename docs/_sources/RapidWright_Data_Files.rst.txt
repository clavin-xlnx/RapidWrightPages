In order to support the set of Xilinx devices and their corresponding
data models in RapidWright, data files are used to access that
information.  These data files are completely separate from Vivado but
are included with each release.  As of RapidWright 2021.1.0, there are
currently two ways to obtain these files:

1. The conventional method is a one-time download of the
   ``rapidwright_data.zip`` file associated with each release.
2. If the user chooses not to download the zip file in option #1,
   RapidWright is now equiped for data file on-demand delivery via
   cloud access (requires an Internet connection at runtime).  

All of the code involved in downloading and checking for data files is
in the open source portion of RapidWright.  Most of the code is found
in ``com.xilinx.rapidwright.util.FileTools``.  All data files are
specified by an MD5 checksum with a master list checked in at
``src/com/xilinx/rapidwright/util/DataVersions.java``.  When
the user calls an API that requires a RapidWright data file, it will
check the local file MD5 against the ``DataVersions.java`` to ensure
they match.  RapidWright caches the current data file's MD5 by
creating a small file alongside the data file with a ``.md5``
extension for speed.  If the file is missing or doesn't match that
expected MD5, it will attempt to download the file.  This will happen
behind the scenes transparent to the user with the exception that the
first time call will take a bit longer since it is downloading the
file.  

If desired, a user can turn off the on-demand data file download
feature by calling ``FileTools.setOverrideDataFileDownload(true)``.
