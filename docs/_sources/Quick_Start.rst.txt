===========================
Quick Start
===========================
1. Download and install Java JDK 11 (or later) - Any distribution such as `Adoptium <https://adoptium.net/>`_ should work
2. Download the `latest standalone RapidWright release jar file <https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright/releases/latest>`_ 

3. Start the RapidWright Python (`Jython <http://www.jython.org>`_) interpreter by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ java -jar rapidwright-2018.3-standalone-lin64.jar # (or whichever jar you downloaded)
  
At this point you should have a Python interpreter instance running with most RapidWright classes loaded.  You can test your install by running the following at the prompt:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> DeviceBrowser.main([])

You should see the GUI come up similar to this screenshot:

.. image:: images/DeviceBrowser.png

	:align: center

If you have gotten to this point, congrats!  Your RapidWright install is correctly configured and you are ready to start experimenting.  

Note that the standalone jar comes pre-packaged with a few select devices:

  * AWS-F1: Virtex UltraScale+ VU9P (xcvu9p)
  * PYNQ-Z1: Zynq 7020 (xc7z020)
  * Virtex UltraScale VU440 (xcvu440)

Additional devices are downloaded over the Internet on demand when the code attempts to
load them.  See :ref:`RapidWright Data Files` for more details.
