Manual Install 
=================================================
RapidWright source code and data files are hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright>`_.  Here is how to get the necessary files to get started:

Run the following from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright.git
    cd RapidWright
    ./gradlew compileJava

This will clone a copy of RapidWright from GitHub, download jar
dependencies and compile the Java code.  Checking out and compiling
the code can also be accomplished by using an IDE (see
:ref:`RapidWright Eclipse Setup` or :ref:`RapidWright IntelliJ Setup`). 

To perform a quick test to ensure RapidWright is setup correctly, try
running the following:
    
.. code-block:: bash
    
    java -cp bin:jars/* com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.browser.DeviceBrowser

.. note:: If you prefer to run with Gradle, the same tool can be invoked with: ``./gradlew run --args=DeviceBrowser``
    
You should see the GUI come up similar to this screenshot:

.. image:: images/DeviceBrowser.png
	:width: 550px
	:align: center
		
If you have gotten to this point, congrats!  Your RapidWright install
is correctly configured and you are ready to start experimenting.

A Couple of Notes:
===================

CLASSPATH
-----------
Java has the notion of a CLASSPATH, this is a list of locations where
`java` can look for compiled Java code (`.class` files or `.jar`
files) to execute at runtime.  The CLASSPATH can be set on the command
line (as in the example test command above) or it can be set via the
environment variable `CLASSPATH`.  If a script to set the `CLASSPATH`
variable (in Linux) is desired, the following command can be run:
    
.. code-block:: bash
    
    echo "export CLASSPATH=`pwd`/bin:`pwd`/jars/*" > bin/rapidwright_classpath.sh


    
This sets up the environment so the `-cp bin:jars/*` classpath option doesn't need to be set
as an argument when invoking `java`, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    source bin/rapidwright_classpath.sh
    java com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.browser.DeviceBrowser

Should start the `DeviceBrowser` just as before.
    

RAPIDWRIGHT_PATH
-----------------
The environment variable `RAPIDWRIGHT_PATH` is no longer required.  It
can be set in the event that the user has an existing data set of
files that they want to use or override the existing set.
