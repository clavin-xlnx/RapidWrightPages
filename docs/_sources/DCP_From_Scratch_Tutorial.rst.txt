How to Create a DCP From Scratch
=================================================

What You'll Need to Get Started:
  - RapidWright
  - Vivado 2017.3 or later
   
This tutorial will generate a completely implemented design in a DCP file solely from RapidWright code.  Generating implementations directly from source code will open new doors into FPGA tools and research.   

TODO - Still work in progress.
